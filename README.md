# Advent of Code 2018
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 (https://adventofcode.com/2018)

This year my target is to solve the problems in Scala using Functional Programming

Each solution is covered by a unit test

## Solutions

### Day 1
#### Part 1
A simple sum of input parameters that reduces to correct value

#### Part 2
Memoization of seen values in a Set and recurssion to iterate throught the input array

### Day 2
#### Part 1
Maps the input to character count map and then counts how many lines meet the requirement

#### Part 2
Counts the differences between inputs and then selects valid two to compute the intersection
